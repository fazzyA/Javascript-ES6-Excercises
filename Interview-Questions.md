## Suppose you are given two strings s and t. String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then adding one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to t.
### Example 1:
### Input: s "abcd", t = "ceadb"
### Output: "e"
## Explanation:
### "cadb" was produced by random shuffling "abcd" and "e" was added in as the second letter.
### Example 2:
### Input: s "abbdd", t = "dabadb"
### Output: "a"
### Example 3:
### Input: s = "", t = "y"
### Output: "y"
### Example 4:
### Input: s "aaaa", t = "aabaa"
### Output: "b":
### Example 5:
### Input: s "ae", t = "aae"
### Output: "a"
