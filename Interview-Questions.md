## ------ Question 1 -------------
## Suppose you are given two strings s and t. String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then adding one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to t.
## Example 1:
### Input: s "abcd", t = "ceadb"
### Output: "e"
## Explanation:
### "cadb" was produced by random shuffling "abcd" and "e" was added in as the second letter.
## Example 2:
### Input: s "abbdd", t = "dabadb"
### Output: "a"
## Example 3:
### Input: s = "", t = "y"
### Output: "y"
## Example 4:
### Input: s "aaaa", t = "aabaa"
### Output: "b":
## Example 5:
### Input: s "ae", t = "aae"
### Output: "a"

## ------ Question 2 -------------
﻿
# Absolute difference value
## You are given non-negative numbers array nums
• The sum of all the integers in nums abbreviated as number sum.
• The sum of all the individual digits that appear in nums. abbreviated as digit sum Return the positive difference between the number sum and digit sum of nums
## Example 1:
### Input: nums = [3,25,8,5]
### Output: 9
## Explanation:
### The element sum of nums is 3+25+8+5=41.
### The digit sum of nums is 3+2+5+8+5=23.
### The absolute difference between the element sum and digit sum is 141-231 = 18.
