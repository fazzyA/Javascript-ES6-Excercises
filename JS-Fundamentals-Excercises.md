## 18 write a function that generates random number between given two inputs
## 19 write a function that generates number between 1-10 and find the item in array witrh index of this number.  for example if random number 5 is generated it will return item in array with 5 index.  [11, 22 , 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99,10] "your item at index 5 is 66"
## What is logged to the console here?
